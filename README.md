a sudoku solver i built using python for TKinter practice. my plan is to keep adding strategies with each new version.


v1.0 implicit/explicit singles

v2.0 locked pairs

v3.0 locked/hidden triples

v4.0 pointing pairs/triples

v5.0 spearated my reduction routine into 2 algorithms to preserve notes through iterations

v6.0 box/line reduction

v7.0 x-wing
